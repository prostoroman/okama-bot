## PORTFOLIO_COMMAND_IO_IMPORT_FIX_REPORT

### Summary
- Fixed runtime error "name 'io' is not defined" when executing `/portfolio` (and other commands using image buffers) by adding the missing standard library import in `bot.py`.

### Root Cause
- `bot.py` used `io.BytesIO()` to send images to Telegram but did not import the `io` module at the top of the file.

### Fix
- Added `import io` to the standard library imports section of `bot.py`.

### Files Changed
- `bot.py`: add `import io` under standard library imports

### Validation
- Ran unit tests and lint checks: no regressions.
- Manually verified chart-sending paths use `io.BytesIO()` without NameError.

### Deployment
- Committed and pushed to trigger CI/CD autodeploy.
