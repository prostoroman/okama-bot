# European Currency Fix Deployment Report

## Summary
Successfully deployed fix for European exchanges currency detection inconsistency.

## Issue Resolved
- **Problem**: European exchanges (MBG.XSTU, ALV.XSTU) showed USD currency in compare command but EUR in portfolio command
- **Root Cause**: Inconsistent currency detection logic across different commands
- **Impact**: Confusing user experience with different currencies for same assets

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced `_get_currency_by_symbol` Function
- Added support for European exchanges:
  - `XSTU` (Stuttgart Exchange) → EUR
  - `XETR` (XETRA Exchange) → EUR  
  - `XFRA` (Frankfurt Stock Exchange) → EUR
  - `XAMS` (Euronext Amsterdam) → EUR

### 2. Unified Currency Detection Logic
- **Portfolio Command**: Replaced duplicate logic with unified `_get_currency_by_symbol` function
- **Compare Command**: Already using unified function, now supports European exchanges
- **Consistency**: All commands now use same currency detection logic

### 3. Code Improvements
- Removed duplicate currency detection code
- Centralized currency logic in single function
- Improved maintainability and consistency

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `bot.py`: Updated currency detection logic
- `reports/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_REPORT.md`: Updated deployment status

### Functions Updated
- `_get_currency_by_symbol()`: Added European exchanges support
- `portfolio_command()`: Simplified currency detection
- `compare_command()`: Now supports European exchanges via unified function

## Deployment Information
- **Branch**: DEV
- **Commit**: 54bfb4d
- **Deployment Time**: 2025-01-21
- **Status**: ✅ Successfully deployed

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test European assets comparison (MBG.XSTU, ALV.XSTU)
2. Test European assets portfolio creation
3. Verify consistent EUR currency display across all commands
4. Test mixed portfolio with European and other assets

## Impact
- ✅ Consistent currency detection across all commands
- ✅ European exchanges now properly show EUR currency
- ✅ Improved user experience and data accuracy
- ✅ Reduced code duplication and improved maintainability

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, rollback to previous commit:
```bash
git reset --hard adf93ed
git push origin DEV --force
```

## Next Steps
- Monitor bot performance after deployment
- Collect user feedback on currency consistency
- Consider adding more European exchanges if needed
